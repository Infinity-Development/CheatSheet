### File Structure
- Denial Section: [components/denial](./components/denial)

When adding new reasons please make sure you also update the corresponding **features** file.

### Feature Example
```ts
const denyFeatures = [
  {
    name: 'üì° Bot Offline',
    description: `Your bot was offline when we tried to review it. Please get your bot online and re-apply.`,
    click: botOffline
  },
]
```

### Denial Reason Example
```ts
import copy from 'copy-to-clipboard';
import toast, { Toaster } from 'react-hot-toast';

const unknownApp = () => {
    copy('There is an unknown application error when trying to invite your bot. Please make sure that the application ID you entered is correct, you have a bot user with your application and your bot application wasnt deleted');
    toast.success('Copied to clipboard!', {
      duration: 4000,
      position: 'bottom-right',
      icon: 'üëè',
      className: 'flex items-center justify-center px-8 py-3 font-mono text-md font-medium text-color2 bg-dark border rounded border-slate-500',
